rcc5:  composition rules, disjunctive encoding  
bl:      pp rule for blocks (A B1 B2 .. Bn)  -- additional rules needed for partition semantics (sibling disjointness and coverage)

co:     TO-DO -- missing rules for coverage

isa:    pp v eq rule for ISA 

de:    some auxiliary preds for debugging

examples: folder with examples

run-examples.sh: for auto-running examples
