rcc5:  composition rules, disjunctive encoding  

bl:    pp rule for blocks (A B1 B2 .. Bn) - addtl. rules needed for partition semantics (sibling disjointness, coverage)

sd:    dr rule for blocks (A B1 B2 .. Bn) - sibling disjointness (additional rules needed for coverage)

co:    TO-DO - missing rules for coverage

isa:   pp v eq rule for ISA 

de:    auxiliary preds for debugging

examples:        folder with examples

run-examples.sh: for auto-running examples 

python-aux:      helper programs to generate DLV rules or fragments
